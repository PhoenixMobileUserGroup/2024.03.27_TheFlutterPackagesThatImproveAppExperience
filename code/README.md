### Handling Serialization and Deserialization with JSON

To streamline serialization and deserialization processes within our project, we leverage the robust capabilities of the [json_annotation](https://pub.dev/packages/json_annotation) package.

For seamless integration, we recommend referring to the official json_annotation GitHub page for comprehensive guidance on boilerplate implementation. Once the boilerplate code is in place, executing the following command within the project's base directory will automatically generate conversion code for seamless transformation to and from JSON for our solution models:

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

This streamlined approach ensures efficient data handling, allowing for smooth interoperability between our application and external systems.
